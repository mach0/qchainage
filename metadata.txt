description=This plugin takes line features and creates a new layer of points
    in provided distances on top of this Lines. Optionally you can set the
    startpoint (distance from the start of the line) and the endpoint (stop
    before reaching the end of the line) and automatically label the new
    points with the distances.
about=QChainage is either separating the selected (or all) Line-Features into 
 parts, or linear referencing after a chosen distance. All along the whole
 Feature or between selectable start and endpoint.
