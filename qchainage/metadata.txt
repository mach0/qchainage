description=This plugin takes line features and creates a new layer of points
    in provided distances on top of these Lines. Optionally you can set the
    startpoint (distance from the start of the line) and the endpoint (stop
    before reaching the end of the line) and automatically label the new
    points with the specified range.
about=QChainage either separates the selected (or all) Line-Features into 
 parts, or performs linear referencing from a chosen distance. Chainage can be 
 all along the whole feature or between a selectable start and endpoint.

changelog=
    3.5.1 Fix support for ALL linear units (centimeters, millimeters, feet, etc.) on geographic CRS
    3.5.0 Implement accurate meter-based chainage for geographic (degree) CRS using distance mapping
    3.4.5 Fix unit conversion for geographic coordinates - use cartesian distances and proper meter-to-degree conversion
    3.4.4 Fix infinite loop bug and simplify unit conversion - works for ALL units directly
    3.4.3 Fix unit conversion using QgsUnitTypes.fromUnitToUnitFactor() - correct meters to degrees conversion
